# Automated_ML_Pipeline_with_H2O
This Jupyter notebook creates an automated machine learning pipeline using the H2O library to classify census income data. It loads data, splits it into training and testing sets, and then uses H2OAutoML to train and evaluate various models to predict income levels.
